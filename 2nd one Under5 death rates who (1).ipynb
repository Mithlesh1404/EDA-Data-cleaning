Exploratory Data Analysis using Python
Analysing global under5 Death rates

You can find the raw data & official analysis here: https://platform.who.int/data/maternal-newborn-child-adolescent-ageing/indicator-explorer-new/mca/number-of-under-five-deaths---by-cause



There are several options for getting the dataset into Jupyter:

Download the CSV manually and upload it via Jupyter's GUI
Use the urlretrieve function from the urllib.request to download CSV files from a raw URL
Use a helper library, e.g., opendatasets, which contains a collection of curated datasets and provides a helper function for direct download.
I have downloaded the csv manually and uploaded it via Jupyter's GUI

Data Preparation & Cleaning While the survey responses contain a wealth of information, we'll limit our analysis to the following areas:
Clean the data:
Take a copy of the dataset and work on that. Any changes made on the copy will not affect the main dataset
change the name of column to avoid syntax errors
Use describe to roughly check the average deaths in total
check for null values
Remove unwanted columns
Change the column names if you want
check if Global column below is sum of all the other regions,
if yes remove the column Global and remove the rows which says global under region
Check if Value_Numeric and Value_string have same values
if yes remove the column Value_string
Data Analysis and visualisation
Columns we will analyse

Year
Cause
Region
Income group
Problem Statement
Year
Is there a correlation between the year and mortality rates
Which cause was the reason for highest death rates every year
Cause
Maximum death rates by each cause
Which cause was the reason for most no of deaths overall
Total death rate due to each cause throughout the years
Region
Which region(along with the cause) has the highest death rates due to vaccine preventable diseases
a. What is the cause for highest death rates due to vaccine preventable diseases
b) Which region has the highest death rates due to vaccine preventable diseases
Which region has the highest number of under 5 mortality rates
Death rates by contagious diseases(ALRTI,Sepsis and other infectious conditions of the newborn,HIV,diarrhoeal diseases) and other disease conditions in all the regions
Look for South east region death rate distribution
Look for India's data
Income group
Which income group people have most death rates
Take out Income group for all the countries
Find out the which Region has which income groups
Let's extract a copy of the data from these columns into a new data frame survey_df. We can continue to modify further without affecting the original data frame.

copy_df = df.copy()

III. Region
We know malaria and ALRTI are the reason for max death rates but we need to know which region had those max death rates
1. Which cause and region has the highest(max) overall under5 death rates
Africa had the highest death rates due to both Malaria and ALRTI, followed by South-East Asia due to ALRTI,
Europe and America has the lowest death rates of all

I have taken only year 2019
Death rates due to non contagious diseases seems to be higher in all the countries compared to contagious disease
one of the reasion may be routine vaccinations are administered for contagious diseases while non contagious diseases however cannot be prevented but can be detected, screened at the early stage and provide access to palliative care for people in need
Timely treatment and early treatment can reduce the death rates due to non contagious diseases

India seems to have the highest death rates compared to other South-East asian countries
However India's population is higher than all the other countries population
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.set_size_inches(20, 15)
grid = sns.FacetGrid(South_East , col = 'Country', hue = 'Cause',palette ='bright', col_wrap=5)
grid.map(sns.scatterplot, "Year","Value_Numeric" )

grid.add_legend()
plt.show()
<Figure size 1440x1080 with 0 Axes>

6. Look into India's death rate data
India_data = copy_df.loc[copy_df['Country']=='India'][["Year","Cause","Country","Income_group","Value_Numeric"]]
India_2019 = India_data.loc[India_data['Year']==2019][["Year","Cause","Country","Value_Numeric"]]
In the year 2019 highest death rate is due to prematurity followed by other non communicable diseases followed by birth asphyxia
Common non communicable diseases include anaemia, asthma, cancers, heart diseases
plt.figure(figsize=(20,9))
plt.xticks(rotation=89.5)
plt.title("Deaths_inIndia",fontsize=20)
b = sns.barplot(x=India_2019.Cause, y=India_2019.Value_Numeric, hue =India_2019.Cause)

IV. Income group
1. What income group does India have
India has only Lower middle income group
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
sns.countplot(x='Income_group',data =India_data,palette='bright')
<AxesSubplot:xlabel='Income_group', ylabel='count'>

2. Take out Income group for all the countries
Lower middle income and upper middle income count is more overall
Death rates are higher in the Lower middle income group, followed by Low income. High income shows no much death rates at all
Income_group = copy_df.groupby(['Income_group','Cause','Year','Region'], as_index=False)['Value_Numeric'].sum()
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
#colors = ['blue','green','orange', 'red']
sns.countplot(x='Income_group',data =Income_group,palette='bright' )
<AxesSubplot:xlabel='Income_group', ylabel='count'>

3.Find out the which Region has which income groups
USA and Europe seems to have more of Upper middle income group
Europe has the most high income groups among all the other countries
Africa has the most low income groups among all the other countries
import random
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors

labels = ['USA', 'Europe','Western pacific', 'Africa','Eastern mediterrranean','South east asia']
plt.figure(figsize=(9,8))
colors = ['yellowgreen','pink', 'gold', 'lightskyblue', 'blue',"red"]
copy_df[copy_df['Income_group']== 'Upper middle income']['Region'].value_counts().sort_values(ascending=False).plot.pie(colors=colors,autopct='%1.2f%%')
plt.legend(labels, loc="best")
plt.axis('equal')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Inferences and conclusion
Problem Statement
Year
PROBLEM STATEMENT :Is there a correlation between the year and mortality rates
ANS: There is a negative correlation between the Year and Number of under 5 deaths which means as the year increases the number of deaths has decreased

The year 2000 has approximately 19.8 million under 5 mortality rates which is the highest of all the years

But in the year 2019 the under 5 mortality rate has gone very much down from 19.8 million to around 10.5 million which is the lowest

This may be due to various medical advances, Vaccination coverage and new diagnostic studies

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Each year which cause was the reason for maximum under5 mortality rates and which region gave the maximum death rates each year.
ANS: From the year 2000 to 2009 Malaria has been the causes of maximum deaths and from 2010 to 2019 ALRTI(Acute lower respiratory tract infection)has been the cause of maximum deaths

The main reason might be because there is no vaccination for Malaria

The malaria parasite has an extraordinary ability to evade the immune system, which may explain the failure of malaria vaccines to date.

But in 2021 WHO has recommended RTS,S/AS01 vaccine to fight against malaria

The next most common cause for max death rate is ALRTI which is mostly caused because of FLU

There are many different flu viruses that circulate every year

Despite being vaccinated kids still get FLU as a flu vaccine is made to protect against the three or four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common. There are many other different flu viruses that circulate every year

Cause
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Maximum death rates by each cause
ANS: Malaria has the highest max deaths, followed by ALRTI and other non communicable diseases
Reasons same as above
Next most common causes for max death rates are Diarrhoeal diseases and prematurity
Diarrhoeal diseases cause the next max death rate may be due to poor hygienic practices in many countries and also might be due to poor nutritional status
Prematurity is the next cause for max death rate as many countries is unable to provide Specialized supportive care for the prematured babies
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Which cause was the reason for most no of deaths
ANS: Malaria and ALRTI has been the cause for max death rates
Reasons same as the above
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Total death rate due to each cause throughout the years
ANS: ALRTI seems to be the cause of highest death rates globally
Reasons same as the above
Region
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Which region(along with the cause) has the highest(max) overall under5 death rates
We know malaria and ALRTI are the reason for max death rates but we need to know which region had those max death rates
ANS: Africa had the highest death rates due to both Malaria and ALRTI, followed by South-East Asia due to ALRTI,
Europe and America has the lowest death rates of all
PROBLEM STATEMENT: 2.a) What is the cause for highest death rates due to vaccine preventable diseases 2.b) Which region has the highest death rates due to vaccine preventable diseases
ANS: 2.a)Death rates are mostly due to Measles during 2000 to 2006 post which Tuberculosis, measles and meningitis has become the cause for highest death rates.

Tetanus have always been the cause for the least death rates

ANS: 2.b)Africa seems to have the highest death rates due to measles followed by south east asia due to Tuberculosis

Europe and America have the least death rates due to vaccine preventable diseases.

Africa is the second most populous region may be the vaccination coverage is less

Certain people doubt the vaccine safety may be that is why the death rates are high in India and Africa even for vaccine preventable diseases

In the year 2019 Africa still seems to have the highest death rates among all the other countries

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Which region has the highest number of under 5 mortality rates
ANS: South East Asia seems to have the highest under 5 mortality rates overall
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Death rates by contagious diseases(ALRTI,Sepsis and other infectious conditions of the newborn,HIV,diarrhoeal diseases) in all the regions
ANS: I have taken only year 2019
Death rates due to non contagious diseases seems to be higher in all the countries compared to contagious disease
one of the reasion may be routine vaccinations are administered for contagious diseases while non contagious diseases however cannot be prevented but can be detected, screened at the early stage and provide access to palliative care for people in need
Timely treatment and early treatment can reduce the death rates due to non contagious diseases
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Look for South east region death rate distribution
ANS: India seems to have the highest death rates compared to other South-East asian countries
However India's population is higher than all the other countries population
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Look into India's death rate data
ANS: In the year 2019 highest death rate is due to prematurity followed by other non communicable diseases followed by birth asphyxia
Common non communicable diseases include anaemia, asthma, cancers, heart diseases
Income group
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Which income group people have most death rates
ANS: Death rates in the Lower middle income group is more, followed by Low income. High income shows no much death rates at all
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Take out Income group for all the countries
ANS: Lower middle income and upper middle income count is more overall
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Find out the which Region has which income groups
ANS: USA and Europe seems to have more of Upper middle income group
Europe has the most high income groups among all the other countries
Africa has the most low income groups among all the other countries
